Toolchain, OS and the Pi Zero
=============================
At the moment I work on the toolchain, such as the Linker or Disk utility.
The project is at its infancy and is designed to take a long time, so I 
have delicious to work on when I have time to tinker with it. The whole
thing is MIT licensed, so no strings attached if you want to play around.
However I have only tested it on Windows 7 and at the time of writing
the Disk utility is hardwired to the WinApi. 

I have no clear idea of what the system is supposed to be able to, but
I plan to experiment with just about anything related such as file system
design, language design, hardware and so on.
